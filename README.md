# Cocktail-Party

This repository contains the code that seperates out different voices in an audio clip. It is the implementation of CockTail Party Algorithm and coding help is taken from Stanford University's course on Machine Learning on Coursera.

mix1.wav and mix2.wav are recordings of two same sounds mixed together in different frequencies. The Matlab code of applies the algorithm on these files and produces the files refined1.wav and refined2.wav which contains both the sounds differently.
